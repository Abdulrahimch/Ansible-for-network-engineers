In the GRE role, we configred the GRE tunnel on all spokes and MGRE  on the hub.this is done by creating a template in GRE role.
For mapping NBMA address to tunnel address we used the NHRP protocol. all spoeks register thierselves dynamically to the hub.
R1 is the hub in our topology.
R2, R3, R4, R% are spokes.
